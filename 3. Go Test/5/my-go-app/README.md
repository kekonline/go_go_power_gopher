## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-go-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```
   cd my-go-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```
   go run src/main.go
   ```

## Usage

This application serves as an educational tool to learn Go programming. Each file in the `src` directory demonstrates specific features of the language. You can explore each file to understand how different concepts are implemented.

## Examples

- **Variables and Constants:** Check `variables.go` and `constants.go` for examples of variable declarations and constant usage.
- **User Input:** See `user_input.go` for handling user input from the console.
- **Error Handling:** Refer to `error_handling.go` for examples of panic and recover.
- **Control Flow:** Explore `control_flow.go` for if-else statements, loops, and switch cases.
- **File Operations:** Look at `file_operations.go` for reading and writing files.
- **Concurrency:** Check `concurrency.go` for goroutines and channels.
